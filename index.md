# Projects

Below is a list of projects showcasing some of the skills I have developed through undergraduate and masters level coursework, certifications, and self study.

## Time Series Analysis with ARIMA and SARIMA

**Project Overview**: The primary goal of this project was to accurately forecast river flow for recreational purposes by using historical observations collected from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Another goal was to develop a Python package for performing time series analysis and forecasting on a given dataset, and organizing the results to be easily accessed. The main features of this module are summarized below:

* Preprocessing: merging multiple datasets, imputing missing data, data resampling, column renaming and deletion, reading raw data with a user defined delimiter, 
* Dataframe Creation
* Parameter Estimation: plots and tables rendered for parameter estimation can be viewed in the directory structure explanation at the bottom of the readme file
* Model Fitting
* Diagnostics
* Cross Validation
* Auto ARIMA
* File Handling

Module for preprocessing raw data, creating dataframes, generating plots and tables for parameter estimation, fitting the data to the models, producing diagnostic outputs for model analysis, creating forecast and cross validation results plots, running auto-ARIMA and auto-SARIMA methods, and file handling.



Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
